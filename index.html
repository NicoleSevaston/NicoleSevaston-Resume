        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Nicole Sevaston, a second-year Psychology student currently enrolled in the University of California, Riverside. I am also both a second generation immigrant and college student. 

Currently, I am a data analyst working under the City of Riversideâ€™s Enterprise Risk Division of the Public Utilities Department, collecting and interpreting data to answer questions related to costs of public utilities. My primary responsibilities include data collection and reporting to my team for further analysis.
<br><br>

        Within my role as a data analyst, I have been able to streamline data collection in order to speed up the information cycle that my division undergoes with each project - coding software to automatically encode information into spreadsheets as it gets inputted into our systems.

What drives me in my work is the ability to help others through efficiency. I greatly value organization and assisting in the allocation of materials and funds so that people have better access to the resources that they need. Though an invisible job, I work to ensure the well-being of my community. Additionally, I am dedicated to learning new things every day, adding to my ever-growing collection of skills that I can use every day to help others and get jobs done.
<br><br>

        Outside of work, I love spending time with my family and friends, who support me every day. My mother in particular is my inspiration as a dedicated hard-working mother of three who never rested until her work was done, and made sure it was done with the best quality possible. As a Hermosa Beach local, I love visiting the beach for a swim, as well as indulging my creative side with painting and writing in my spare time. My hobbies include digital painting and sewing, but I have recently gotten into prop-making as well. Most often, I donâ€™t have time to dedicate to huge projects, so I usually read in between work and school. I also dedicate myself to small coding projects such as websites or personal features for my home desktop.

My current project is a website for the Computer Science class I am currently enrolled in, and inputting a biography of appropriate length and tone. Not only does this exercise strengthen my skills as a coder, but also as a writer. Stretching my muscles for writing a hypothetical professional bio is fantastic practice for when I land a more stable occupation, as I am not truly employed as a data analyst for the city of Riverside. This is my third Learn CS8 Lab, and I would like to finish it before Thursday so that I have time to focus on studying for the upcoming midterm in this very class, as well as the comic that I have committed myself to work on and finish by Friday morning. 500 words may sound trivial at first, but can be a daunting task when not given any prompting, often leading to drawn out sentences and mouthfuls of words - many of them unnecessary and just existing to fill the space.
